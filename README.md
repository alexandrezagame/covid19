# Covid19 Tracker

## Description
Corona Virus is, unfortunately, spreading through the entire world. What can we, as developers, do to make the situation better? We can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data. The data is fetched from the API and we'll create cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts.

## Technology
Covid19 uses React, Axios to fetch the api, @Mathdroid-api to track the daily numbers, Chartjs to display the chart and bar, Material UI and Netlify to deploy the application.
